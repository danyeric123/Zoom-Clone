# Description
A Zoom clone that does the basic functionality of connecting two users using Socket.io and Peer.js
The idea came from [WebDevSimplified](https://github.com/WebDevSimplified/Zoom-Clone-With-WebRTC) and some of the styling came from [here](https://github.com/Div685/Zoom-Clone)

### Technologies and Libraries Used
- EJS
- CSS
- Vanilla Javascript
- Node.js
- Express
- Socket.io
- UUID
- Peer.js

# Motivation
I wanted to learn a bit of Node and Express, and thought it would be fun to throw in some Socket.io since it seems important. 

# Strech Goals
1. Allow user to mute and unmute
2. Allow user to turn on and off camera
3. Create usernames (possibly through MongoDB?)
4. Build out a chat box
5. Add some more styling
